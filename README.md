# PROJECT TITLE:
# Building a next best action model using machine learning model.
#### Primary Goal : Our main aim here is to increase the conversion rate of customers (from churn customer to active customer) by recommending the right products to different categories of customer.
#### This can be achieved by dividing the whole project into 2 stages.
### SATGE 1 : Classifieng the customer into two classes churn or active . 
### STAGE 2 : Once our model is able to accurately classify the customers into 2 groups our next stage is to classify them into further groups , so that our model can recommend right product or service to a customer.

## METHODOLOGY
#### AGILE CRISP-DM METHODOLOGY is used for this project
#### AGILE CRISP-DM :Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), which has been in practice since 1997, is a data mining process model. It is a robust and proven methodology for guidance. This framework is tool-agnostic and application/industry neutral. The main advantage of going with CRISP-DM is it focuses on business problems as well as data analysis. We could bring together agile and scrum with CRISP-DM to make sense of data transformation.
#### * Meet with key stakeholders to get the vision and value for the data transformation
#### * Identify the team and roles â€“ product owner, scrum master, data scientist, business analyst, SME, lead, and data developers.
#### * Identify the sprint length that is suitable for the organization and the project.
#### * Set up the baseline architecture, continuous integration architecture, and framework for deployments. 
#### * Set up project infrastructure and conventions, schedule project activity and track and report progress.

## MODEL BUILDING
#### We are still working on stage 1 process where our main goal is to classify churn or active customers accurately .Once stage 1 is completed we are planning to release our model into production and monitor the results of our model. If our model meets the target, we will be moving  onto next stage 2.
#### Tried various machine algorithams and methods.
#### Based on the precision and recall value or stability of model we chose random forest model.
# DEPLOYMENT ON HEROKU SERVER
### Real-time Interactive Web App on Heroku server
#### web app has been deployed on Heroku.

## WHAT'S NEXT ?
#### The model has been passed to UAT (User Acceptance test ). Once the UAT process is done we are palnning to release the model into production environment and monitor for couple of montths.
